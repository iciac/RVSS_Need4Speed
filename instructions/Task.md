## Your task is to train a robot to drive along a 'road'.

### In this year's workshop  you will deploy a deep neural network on a mobile robot. You will go through all the stages of this process: data collection and labelling, network architecture design and implementation, training and testing, deployment on the robot and task execution. 

Given an RGB image from the robot's camera, you will train a deep neural network to produce a steering command that safely drives the robot along the road. Performance will be measured by how **quickly and accurately** (not crossing off the road) your robot completes the test track. 

## Marking Criteria

Your robot's performance driving on the track will be judged by it's **speed**, **accuracy** and **robustness**.
Your final score will be a time, and the team with the lowest time will win.
The scoring rules are listed below:
- There are 3 tracks available to be attempted:
  * 'The Beginner Track': this will have black/white track tiles, with no gaps in the track. **+10 seconds added to your time.**
  * 'The Intermediate Track': this will have green/grey track tiles, with no gaps in the track. **+5 seconds added to your time.**
  * 'The Advanced Track': this will have black/white AND green/grey track tiles, with a gap in the track. **No penalty.**
- If your robot has an entire wheel outside the track (aka. outside the white road line) - **+2 seconds added to your time.**
- If your robot leaves the track, you are allowed to place it back on the track from the position it left - **+5 seconds added to your time.**
